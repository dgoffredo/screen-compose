    Even though this is a shell heredoc, it's still indented.
    screen-compose does not interpret the content of code blocks at all.
    Instead, it determines the indentation from the first indented line and
    then copies the script into screen, stripping only the common indentation.

  # Here we used two spaces instead of the four spaces above. It's fine as long
  # as you're consistent within a block. Tabs are not allowed.

# It's not part of the script above, because it's not indented.
